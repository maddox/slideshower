h1. Slideshower!

h2. What?

Simple way to generate the json that will power a future iPhone app that does simple slide shows.

h2. Install

<code>sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com</code>
<code>sudo gem install maddox-slideshower</code>

h2. Usage

Go to a directory containing all the images you want in the slide show and run:

<code>slideshower</code>

Slideshower will take all the image files in the directory and put them into a json string located at index.json.

The url to this directory will eventually be used for a sweet free iPhone app. It's an easy way to show your client iPhone mocks.
